  <h3>Genocide is defined as the intentional destruction of a people in whole or in part. It is defined as any of the following actions taken against a group of people: killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group. As of 2023, about 1.5% of countries are at risk of experiencing genocide. Some countries/groups currently at risk of genocide include Armenia, Syria, Ukraine, Kurdistan, and Zimbabwe </h3>
